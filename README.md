## Description
- I was given the task of recreating my personal portfolio of work as a multi-page website using the [React](https://reactjs.org) framework.
- The site demonstrates my skills as a front-end developer and highlights my strongest work linking to deployed web applications.
- The site has been styled using [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) with additional CSS styling overrides.
- The site has 4 distinct pages, with a navigation bar at the top of the page (collapses at smaller screen sizes) linking to each section. These sections are as follows:
  - About
  - Projects
  - Skills
  - Contact
- The about page contains a brief description about my life as a front-end devleoper and a donwload link to my CV
- The projects section contains titled images of my projects/applications with the first application's image displaying larger in size than the others.
- Buttons to the deployed application and github repo appear, overlayed on the project card's image, when the user hovers over a project card.
- When the buttons in the project cards are clicked the user is taken to that deployed application in a new browser tab/window (entire card is also clickable).
  - The projects page is also filterable through a search field and the top of the gallery
- The site is fully responsive and adapt to the user viewport, working equally well on desktop and mobile
- The skills page contains progress bars displaying the percentage of various coding languages that have been utilised in my projects that animate in on page load. In addition to those there are also skillls badges for my entire dev stack.
